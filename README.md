whoseUVa
========
Practically, this is a personal repository, 
storing my own solution of [UVa OJ Problem sets](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/ "UVa OJ").

Correctness
-----------
Most of the solution are ACCEPT by UVa OJ.
Which means it should be corect, at least for the competition situation.

However, if you found it is fun to correct my solutions to meet 100% correctness,
send the pull request and I will review it. 
Please refer to the **Contribution** part below.

Contribution
------------
At this moment, I am NOT going to make this repository 
an ultimate UVa solution collection.

So the new commits of solutions is now allowed except for myself,
such kind of pull request will mostly be closed with a little nice chat.

But, the pull request of correcting the exist problems in this repo
would be reviewed and likely be merged if it is proved correct.
The meaning of "prove" here is to prove the solution by a working theory,
not by the online judges.
